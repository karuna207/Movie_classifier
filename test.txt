Do not compare this one with Robot, Aparichit or I movie or even Shivaji 🎥 it’s different the only film I didn’t like of Shankar is robot part two and now this one 

I thought it would be same like his most films but Unfortunately the opposite happens Kamal’s introduction and the entire fight sequence give us a clear hint about where the film might be headed The makeup and long hair used for this crucial sequence provide fodder for the troll army It’s hard to believe that a perfectionist like Shankar approved such a look 👀 Everyone expected fireworks from SJ Suryah role and performance 🎭 but it is outright forgettable

You don’t have to watch Hindustani part one to understand this movie 🍿 Recap is already given in the film 🎞 What follows is also very basic in terms of writing and presentation Senapathy arrives in India at the behest of a quick request to tackle corruption 

Here Shankar fails to establish a solid cause that would make the audience root for Senapathy Instead the story drifts from one place to another, picking random corruption targets from society without a clear direction

There is lack of flow The biggest issue is the confusion with the core idea 💡 Shankar wants to establish the unique concept that youth should reject the benefits that corrupt parents provide through fraudulent practices However he fails to convey this with emotion; instead, what he presents is a youth that revolts against Senapathy highlighting his failure in the second part

The second half of Indian part two is slightly better compared to the first half due to the increased drama 🎭 whether it works or not The late actor Vivek does his job Priya Bhavani Shankar has good screen presence but was not utilized much to the film’s benefit

 Brahmanandam plays a forgettable special role Others like Samuthirakani and Manobala do their usual performances Cinematography by Ravi Varman matches the scale of director Shankar, but the way the story shifts from one state to another and the lackluster drama ruin the impact of any camera work

the music by Anirudh Ravichander is a disaster in every sense; he did not even compensate for it with his background score. Anirudh’s work is a great injustice to a sequel like Indian, which has been backed by evergreen music from A. R. Rahman. This once again highlights the shortcomings of the current generation of music directors.

Editing by Sreekar Prasad is not good at all. Not only does the film feel boring and unnecessarily lengthy, but the issues are also right in our face, and he lets them go in chunks. Even Kamal Hassan acting is same like all his movies good but feels monotonous as it’s always same 🤷‍♀️

Wait till it gets released on ott platform
 
Don’t waste money 💵 better watch Kill or Maharaja of sethupathi
